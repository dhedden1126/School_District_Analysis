# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The data collected will assist in the analysis needed for understanding of money being spent on students translates into increased reading and math scores. It also will allow us to gain insights to which schools, grades, and students performed well or poorly.

### Analysis & Summary

- The district summary shows a baseline of total budget, average math & reading scores, and overall passing percentages. This can now be used to compare year over year data as time passes.

- Below, we can see both top performing schools in the district as well as those schools that may need additional support to improve student performance. This is based on the overall passing percentage of the number of students.

- By backing out the 9th grade scores, it reflects a decrease in student performance across the board. There's a decrease in overall passing percentages down to ~65%

- Data shows the benefits of having a smaller size school is an indicator to better overall student performance. This may be to student-teacher ratios or other factors

- Spending ranges per student also shows that there's not a direct correlation between dollars spent and student performance.

## Summary
There are clear advantages to having smaller schools and making the most of your resources to preserve spending per student. It's critical to look at the data in multiple ways to conclude meaningful insights to drive performance metrics.
